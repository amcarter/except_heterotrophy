Shifts in Klamath River metabolism following a reservoir cyanobacterial bloom,"Genzoli, Laurel and Hall, Robert O.","Freshwater science, 2016, Vol.35 (3), p.795-809",41.84164,-123.2109,11520500,Klamath River,"Klamath River tended toward autotrophy during the study (Mean total NEP at all sites was 1.6 ± 2.0 g O2/m2/d). NEP decreased and heterotrophic days increased with distance downstream (Seiad had greatest NEP and fewest heterotrophic days; Turwar had lowest NEP and greatest number of heterotrophic days). Seiad mean NEP ~ 3 mg O2/m2/d, range ~ -0.1 - 7 mg O2/m2/d. GPP range ~ 3.5 - 14.5 mg O2/m2/d. ER range ~ -0.5 - -10.5 mgO2/m2/d",CA,Dam tail waters,
